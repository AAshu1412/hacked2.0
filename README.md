# Introduction

The Waste-to-Energy Platform is a decentralized solution designed to revolutionize how we manage organic waste and harness renewable energy. By connecting households and businesses with local waste-to-energy conversion facilities, our platform incentivizes eco-friendly waste disposal while promoting the generation of clean energy.
